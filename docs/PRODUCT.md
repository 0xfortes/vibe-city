# PRODUCT.md — Vision, Concept & MVP Scope

## One-Liner

**VibeCITY is a living city personality engine where AI agents debate what you should do tonight — not a chatbot, not a search tool, but a spectator sport for city discovery.**

---

## The Problem

Every city discovery app is the same: search bar → list of results → reviews. It's Google Maps with lipstick. TripAdvisor with AI. Nobody opens these apps for fun. Nobody shares a list of restaurants.

## The Insight

People don't want *information* about cities — they want to *feel* the city before they arrive. They want opinions, contradictions, hot takes, and the insider knowledge that makes a trip legendary. They want what they'd get if they had 5 opinionated local friends arguing about where to take them.

---

## The Concept: The Council

VibeCITY drops 5 AI agents into every city. Each has a distinct personality, perspective, and domain:

| Agent | Name | Domain | Personality |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 🦉 | The Nightowl | Nightlife & After Dark | Bold, opinionated, knows every door policy and secret party |
| 🍜 | The Foodie | Food & Drink | Passionate, specific, will fight over taco rankings |
| 🎭 | The Culture Vulture | Art, Music, Events | Cerebral, taste-maker, always knows what's opening |
| 🏮 | The Local Legend | Insider Knowledge | Been there 10 years, knows what tourists never find |
| 🧭 | The Wanderer | Exploration & Serendipity | Anti-plan, pro-getting-lost, believes the city reveals itself |

**These agents don't just answer questions — they debate each other in real-time.** They disagree. They tag each other. They have hot takes. You watch the debate unfold like a group chat, then steer it by asking follow-up questions.

---

## What Makes It Go Viral

### 1. Vibe Scores (The Shareable Hook)
Every city gets a real-time **Vibe Score** (0-100) with sub-scores for Nightlife, Food, Culture, Locals, and Wander. These update based on events, weather, social signals, and time of day. Users share their city's Vibe Card on Instagram/TikTok like a personality test result. "Berlin is 87 tonight 🔥" becomes a meme format.

### 2. The Council is Entertainment
Unlike chatbots where you type and wait, The Council is a *spectator experience*. Messages appear one by one, agents reference and disagree with each other, and you're watching a live debate. It's closer to a podcast or a group chat than a search engine. People will screenshot these debates and share them.

### 3. Hot Takes > Neutral Info
Every agent has a personality. The Nightowl will trash tourist traps. The Foodie will start wars over which taco stand is best. The Local will gatekeep. This creates emotional reactions — agreement, disagreement, sharing, arguing in comments. Neutral information doesn't go viral. Opinions do.

### 4. "Your Turn" Mechanic
After the agents debate, you get prompted with follow-up questions to steer the conversation. "Tell me more about that parking garage party" or "What would a local NEVER do?" This creates engagement loops and makes every session unique.

### 5. Vibe Alerts (Post-MVP)
Push notifications when a city's vibe spikes: "Tokyo's nightlife score just hit 98 — cherry blossom parties are erupting across Shibuya 🌸" These are shareable, timely, and create FOMO.

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ Not a chatbot (you don't type open-ended prompts)
- ❌ Not a GPT wrapper (agents have persistent personalities, debate each other, and use real-time data)
- ❌ Not a review aggregator (opinions, not star ratings)
- ❌ Not a travel planner (it's a vibe check first, planning second)

## What This IS

- ✅ Entertainment + utility (you open it for fun, leave with a plan)
- ✅ A personality engine for cities
- ✅ A shareable, social-first experience
- ✅ The answer to "should I go there?" before you even search for flights
